But the trainers were patient and taught everything in simple terms: how to calculate costs, how to price my food, how to save money, how to get customers.

                After 12 weeks of training, they gave me ₦150,000 to buy proper cooking equipment and rent a small shop. I couldn't believe it—no one had ever trusted me with that much money. My mentor, Mrs. Adebayo, visited me every month and helped me solve problems.

              <p class="story-body">
                Two years later, my restaurant employs two young women from my community. My children are all in school. I've saved ₦300,000 in the bank. And now I'm mentoring five other women who are starting their businesses. AGEBETTER INITIATIVE didn't just give me money—they gave me confidence and skills that changed my life."

                "When I was in JSS1, my father lost his job as a driver. We had no money for school fees, uniforms, or books. My parents were talking about me staying home to help with housework while my brothers continued school. I was devastated—I loved learning, especially science subjects.
              </p>
              <p class="story-body">
                Then my teacher told us about AGEBETTER INITIATIVE's scholarship program. I applied and was selected! They paid for everything—school fees, uniforms, books, even my WAEC fees. But more than that, they gave me a mentor, Dr. Amina, who is a pharmacist. She encouraged me to join the STEM club and showed me that girls can be scientists too.
              </p>
              <p class="story-body">
                This year, I scored 298 in JAMB and gained admission to study Pharmacy at University of Abuja with a scholarship. My parents are so proud. My younger sister is now also in the AGEBETTER INITIATIVE program. I want to become a pharmacist and come back to help girls in my community achieve their dreams."

                "Our village is 25 kilometers from the nearest hospital. Many people here suffer from treatable conditions because they cannot afford transport to the hospital. When my wife was pregnant with our fourth child, she had no antenatal care because we couldn't make the journey.
              </p>
              <p class="story-body">
                Everything changed when AGEBETTER INITIATIVE's mobile clinic started coming to our village every three months. Real doctors and nurses come here with a van full of equipment and medicines. They check blood pressure, treat malaria, give immunizations to children, and help pregnant women—all completely free.
              </p>
              <p class="story-body">
                The mobile clinic saved my neighbor's baby when they detected severe malaria early and gave treatment immediately. My wife received antenatal care for our baby and delivered safely. Our community is healthier now. People don't have to suffer in silence anymore. We are so grateful to AGEBETTER INITIATIVE for bringing healthcare to us."
